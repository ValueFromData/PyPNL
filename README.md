## PyPNL : Python probabilistic network library

PyPNL is a probabilistic network library in Python. The library consists of a Python API which interfaces to underlying C/C++ inference and learning engines which do all the heavy lifting. The default engine is a forked version of OpenPNL, the probabilistic network library developed by Intel. The API is designed in such a way that other libraries can be interfaced transparently. PyPNL comes with documentation, examples, and a test suite.
