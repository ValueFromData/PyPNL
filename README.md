# PyPNL

[PyPNL](https://github.com/ValueFromData/PyPNL) is a probabilistic network
library in Python. The library consists of a Python API which interfaces to
state of the art C/C++ inference and learning engines. The API design is modular and allows for plug-ins which augment functionality. PyPNL comes with documentation, examples, and a test suite.

## Features

The PyPNL library has a rich set of features for **representation**, **inference**, **learning** and **actions** using probabilistic networks. 

#### Representation

- Discrete nodes
- Continuous nodes
- Utility nodes
- Decision nodes
- Static Bayesian networks
- Dynamic Bayesian networks
- Markov random fields
- Limited memory influence diagrams

#### Inference

- Exact enumeration 
- Junction Tree
- Pearl
- Gibbs sampling

#### Learning

- K2
- Chow-Liu

#### Actions

- Decision nodes
