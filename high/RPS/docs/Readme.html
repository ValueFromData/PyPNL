			The visual game “Rock, Paper, Scissors”
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			“Rock, Paper, Scissors” game is demonstration of PNL and OpenCV libraries 
			integration. A computer chooses next move with using PNL features. Visual 
			interface is realized with using OpenCV.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every move each of two players chooses one of three items: either rock or 
			scissors or paper. We suppose that rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, 
			paper beats rock. A player which selects a right item increases his score by 1 
			point. The goal is to collect more points than another player. The main feature 
			of this game is ability to operate the game with out mouse and keyboard. Input 
			of information is realized via web-camera (a user control the game making 
			special motion which computer can understand).
		</p>
		<p>
			To play this game you need a web-camera connected to your computer, installed 
			OpenCV library and Windows OS.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How computer makes move
		</h2>
		<p>
			To choose next move computer uses a simple Bayesian network which consists of 
			three tabular nodes. The network is shown on the picture below.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="./images/net.gif" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Each node has three states: rock, paper and scissors. The current computer 
			turn depends on the previous computer turn and the previous human turn. At the 
			beginning of game all nodes have uniform distribution. After every move the 
			network is learnt with using all statistics we have by now. The statistics is 
			a set of all combinations  {previous computer turn, previous human turn, the 
			turn computer should make to win} collected since the start. For example if at
			some iteration previous computer turn is paper, previous human turn is rock 
			and human selects scissors then three-tuple {paper, rock, rock} will be added 
			to the statistics.

		<h2>
			Compilation of the game
		</h2>
		<pre>
Open RPS.dsw in IDE VS 6.0.
Add paths to headers (*.h) and to library (*.lib) files of OpenCV (Tools->Options->Directories):
OPENCV\CV\INCLUDE
OPENCV\CXCORE\INCLUDE
OPENCV\OTHERLIBS\HIGHGUI
OPENCV\OTHERLIBS\CVCAM\INCLUDE
OPENCV\LIB
Make sure that corresponding configuration of pnl and pnlhigh projects were built.
Build CVGUI project.
		</pre>
		<h2>
			How to run the game
		</h2>
		<p>
			When program starts it prints all cameras connected to the computer in console 
			window. By default the game selects camera #0. To select another camera you 
			should run the game with an optional parameter “index of the camera”.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How to play the game
		</h2>
		<p>
			The main window is video stream from your web-camera with drawn icons. Each 
			icon is a possible action in the game. To select an icon you should move your 
			hand in the area of this icon.
		</p>
		<p>
			An important notice! The proper exit is possible with using visual interface 
			only. If you can’t exit with using visual interface (for example it is dark in 
			the room where you are) then you should close the process via Task Manager.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Main menu
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are three menu items in the game:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/start.gif" /> Start the game. Select this item to start the 
					game.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/settings.gif" /> Settings of the game. Select this item to 
					show and change settings.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/exit.gif" /> Exit the game. Select this icon to exit the 
					game.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Game
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are rock, paper, scissors and exit items in the game menu:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="./images/rock.gif" />, <img src="./images/paper.gif" />, <img src="./images/scissors.gif" />,
			<img src="./images/exit.gif" />.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can make your move selecting either rock or paper or scissors item. Or you 
			can exit to the main menu selecting exit item.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a score field at the bottom of the screen. In case of activated help 
			mode (show distribution: yes in the settings menu) there is also a field with 
			probability distribution of possible computer moves (probabilities of rock, 
			paper and scissors) in the centre of window. When human makes move computer 
			shows it’s and human’s moves in the center of window and changes the score.
		</p>
		<p>
			To return to the main menu you should select exit item.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Settings
		</h3>
		<p>
		To enter the settings menu you should select item settings in the main menu.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are 4 menu items in the settings menu:
		</p>		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/info.gif" /> Help mode. Select this item to active or deactivate help mode. When help mode is activated computer shows probability distribution of it’s possible moves.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/resolution.gif" /> Change size of the window. You can choose between 640*480, 800*600 and 1024*768 possible resolutions. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/speed.gif" /> Change speed of computer reaction for motion (how long computer should register motion in the area of item to activate it).
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<img src="./images/exit.gif" /> Return to the main menu. Select this icon to return to the main menu.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
