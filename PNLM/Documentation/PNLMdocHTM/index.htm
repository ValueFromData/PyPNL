<hr><h1><a name="ug_Overview">Overview</a></h1>

<p>
This manual describes Probabilistic Network Library for MATLAB (PNLM), the
general tool for working with graphical models. The library contains
high-performance implementation of algorithms for working with Bayesian networks
and Markov networks, such as belief propagation and Junction tree inference,
maximum likelihood and expectation maximization. The library is aimed at a wide
spectrum of graphical models applications including computer vision, pattern
recognition, data mining, and decision theory. The PNLM core engine will be
optimized and parallized to give maximum performance on Intel® Architectures.
</p>


<hr><h2><a name="ug_AboutLib">About This Library</a></h2>

<p>
The library can be roughly divided into three parts:
graphical models that implement graphical models (Bayesian and Markov networks),
including dynamic graphical models (Dynamic Bayesian networks). This part
includes an implementation of the graph structure along with the factors
(tabular and Gaussian so far) to specify the factorized distribution;
inference engines that contain Naive inference, Junction tree inference, and
belief propagation;
learning engines that implement maximum likelihood, expectation maximization,
and score-based structure learning.
</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ug_AboutSoft">About This Software</a></h2>

<p>
The library is open source and free for use on license terms.
The library is available for MATLAB&reg; only.
</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ug_AboutMan">About This Manual</a></h2>

<p>
The manual consists of two parts: User Guide and Reference Manual. The first
part contains the overview of the implemented algorithms together with sample
calls of PNLM functions to solve specific tasks. The second part gives a
systematic description of the objects and their member functions.
</p>


<hr><h2><a name="ug_NameConv">Naming Conventions</a></h2>

<p>
The PNLM software uses the following naming conventions for different items:
All class names start with prefix C, for example, CGraphicalModel .
All global functions start with prefix pnl, for example, pnlDetermineDistributionType.
Every new part of a function name starts with an uppercase character, without
underscore; for example, GetDomainSize.
